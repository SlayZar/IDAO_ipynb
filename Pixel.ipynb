    "## 1. Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a student in wildlife biology, working on a groundbreaking research project at the Starr Park Research Center. Your team has deployed thousands of camera traps across remote wilderness areas to monitor endangered species populations. However, the satellite internet connections in these remote locations have extremely limited bandwidth. Your job is to write code that identifies the most critical pixels in each wildlife photograph so that only the essential visual information needs to be transmitted back to headquarters.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figs/Pixel Fig 1.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of a training set and a test set. Datasets are loaded using `load_from_disk`, and are in the format of `datasets`. Test set is not visible to the contestants.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset there are the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `image`: the image are RGB full color images in PIL format, the size of each image is (224, 224)\n",
    "- `name`: the animal species label\n",
    "- `idx`: unique identifiers used to track the records.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Set (`train_dataset` folder)**:\n",
    "    - The training set is used for training your models/ doing experimentations on and can be accessed and downloaded directly during the competition.\n",
    "    - There are 700 images in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Set (`test_dataset` folder)**: \n",
    "    - These follow the same format as the training set but do not contain the `name` field.\n",
    "    - There are 698 images in test set, which had been separated into 2 testing sets within the ratio of 3:7, i.e. 30% of the data would be used to calculate the Leaderboard A score, another 70% data would be used to calculate the Leaderboard B score.\n",
    "    - The testing set is used to calculate the Leaderboard A score and the Leaderboard B score and is not directly accessible during the competition. Contestants can access the result on Leaderboard A , but cannot access the result on Leaderboard B. The final score would be counted using Leaderboard B only. The subsets for Leaderboard A and Leaderboard B are completely distinct.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Task\n",
    "You are given a dataset of animal photographs and a CLIP model that can do a zero-shot classification of animal species. To conserve bandwidth, you need to retain at most **6.25%** of the pixels of each image, while keeping classification accuracy as high as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, your task is to return **one rectangle mask** for each image, which contain a single rectangular area indicating the area to keep. Each mask is defined by two coordinate tuples: one for the top-left corner and one for the bottom-right corner of the rectangle. Below is a visualization of what the image would look like after applying a rectangular mask using the process from the baseline:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figs/Pixel Fig 2.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coordinate Convention:**\n",
    "- Top-left corner coordinates are **inclusive** (the pixel at this position is included in the mask) \n",
    "- Bottom-right corner coordinates are **exclusive** (the pixel at this position is NOT included in the mask)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you specify coordinates `((10, 20), (15, 25))`, the mask will cover pixels from row 10 to 14 (inclusive) and column 20 to 24 (inclusive), for a total area of 25 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an illustration, if an image size is 3x3 and we wanted to keep only the top-right pixel using coordinates `((0, 2), (1, 3))`, the resulting binary mask would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[0, 0, 1],\n",
    " [0, 0, 0],\n",
    " [0, 0, 0]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a summary of the requirements for your masks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Return one rectangle mask defined by coordinate tuples: `((top, left), (bottom, right))`\n",
    "- Top-left corner coordinates are inclusive, bottom-right corner coordinates are exclusive\n",
    "- The rectangle mask should cover at most *6.25%* of the original pixels (minimum 93.75% reduction of the original pixels)\n",
    "- All images are of size (224, 224), so coordinate values should be within the range [0, 224]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Images would be masked using the mask you created, outside the masked rectangle, all pixels outside the masked rectangle will be replaced with RGB(0, 0, 0) (black) values. The masked image will be then passed through the CLIP model during evaluation, and your task is to keep the classification accuracy of the CLIP model on these masked images as high as possible. **An additional `other` class would be added into the classes for classification** to ensure that your masked image retains actual useful information for the researchers back at Starr Park Headquarters. So for example, if your image doesn't contain any animal information, the model will predict the `others` class instead of predicting a random animal and having a chance of getting it correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to work only with the provided CLIP model and dataset. As a reminder, CLIP generates representations for both text and image, and it can compute a similarity score between them. So if you have ten animal classes, CLIP can look at the provided image and decide which text (class) is closest to the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that your solution would handle the traffic of images for the research center, your code should run in **UNDER 8 MINUTES for the 698 images in the test dataset**. It is recommended that you test your solution on the training set first, which contain 700 images, to understand how much time your solution takes (testing set would take slightly longer due to dataset loading).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Contestants need to submit a notebook file named `submission.ipynb`. The file should output a `.jsonl` file titled `submission.jsonl`, which contains all the generated masks for the dataset split. Each mask in the `submission.jsonl` file should be stored as a tuple of two coordinate tuples: `((top, left), (bottom, right))`, where the top-left corner is inclusive and the bottom-right corner is exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contestants don't need to separate test sets into Leaderboard A and Leaderboard B, the evaluation machine will read `submission.jsonl` and automatically calculate the scores for Leaderboard A and Leaderboard B based on the prediction results and true labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "The submission files must strictly follow the above format and naming; otherwise, the system will not be able to read them correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Score\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric will be **classification accuracy**, defined as the proportion of correctly predicted samples over the total number of evaluated samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your score is the zero-shot classification accuracy of CLIP on the masked test images. **If a submitted mask for an image is invalid (wrong shape, more than 6.25% pixels retained, etc.), that image is counted as incorrect. A sample script is provided to compute the training split score.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Baseline and Training Set\n",
    "\n",
    "- Below you can find the baseline solution.\n",
    "- The dataset is in `training_set` folder.\n",
    "- The highest score by the Scientific Committee for this task is 0.83 in Leader Board B, this score is used for score unification.\n",
    "- The baseline score by the Scientific Committee for this task is 0.19 in Leader Board B, this score is used for score unification."
