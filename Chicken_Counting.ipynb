    "# Chicken Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Problem Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the leader of an AI research team collaborating with Silkie chicken farmers, you are tasked with solving a critical challenge in traditional free-range farming. Accurate counting of livestock is crucial for both farmers and insurance companies, as factors like disease outbreaks and predator invasions can significantly impact the survival rate of these chickens in a short time. While insurance coverage helps mitigate farming risks, the claims process requires precise counting of livestock losses. Your farmers have approached your team for help in developing more accurate, automated counting systems. The challenge before your research team is to develop an optimized Silkie chicken counting model using density estimation techniques that can provide reliable counts to support both farm management and insurance processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team has access to a pretrained feature extractor for Silkie chicken images, but you'll need to design and train the density estimation decoder to create a complete counting solution. Your task is to build upon this foundation by developing an effective decoder architecture and training strategy to achieve accurate chicken counts that farmers and insurance companies can rely on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below figure shows an image in the dataset, as well as the corresponding true density distribution and a predicted density distribution generated by the baseline model. The total density (sum of densities across all areas) is labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figs/Chicken Counting Fig 1.png\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the provided Silkie chicken image dataset is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "datasets/\n",
    "├── train/\n",
    "│   └── A dataset with features:\n",
    "│       ├── `image`: `PIL.Image` with RGB channels (3x720x1280)\n",
    "│       └── `density`: a 2D array of shape 180x320\n",
    "└── base.pth (Pretrained Model)\n",

    "│   └── A dataset with features:\n",
    "│       └── `image`: `PIL.Image` with RGB channels (3x720x1280)\n",
    "└── test_b/\n",
    "    └── A dataset with features:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Training set location: `datasets`, files in this folder are used for model fine-tuning. It contains a train folder, which stores a dataset with 100 images and their corresponding density maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Validation set (test_a) and Test set (test_b): These will be used to evaluate scores on Leaderboard A and Leaderboard B, respectively. They will be inaccessible to contestants. Only the score achieved on test set B will be used for final scoring. \n",
    "\n",

    "- Test set: 100 images.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Validation set (test_a) and Test set (test_b) are not visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Due to limits of computing resources, training density maps are reshaped to $1\\times 180 \\times 320$. **NOTE** the output density map can be viewed as a 2D real number matrix with shape $180\\times 320$, the sum of all matrix values is the count of chickens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to train your own model using the training data to predict density maps, thereby serving the purpose of chicken counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may extend and optimize the given pretrained model to improve its count prediction accuracy. The pretrained model `base.pth` only contains the weights of the first four layers of the model (the feature extraction model), and the function `load_pretrained_weights_partial` in the baseline code can be used to load these partial weights into your model. You may construct a density decoder `DensityDecoder` and combine it with the pretrained feature extraction module to form a complete data prediction model.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This task is the continuation of Satellite Weather Forecasting. A kind remind is the UNET is easily to full GPU memory without any feature engineering. Then, the GPU memory error message will be reported. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow these rules to achieve a score normally:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Your model must output the predicted density map.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Due to limits of computing resources, your output density map should be reshaped to $180 \\times 320$. This is also the shape of target density maps provided in the train dataset.\n",

    "Please submit a **submission.ipynb** that includes the following components:\n",

    "（2）**Evaluation Code**\n",
    "- Evaluate your model on the validation set and test set. \n",

    "- The output should be saved as **`submission.npz`**. This must be a valid `npz` file containing two arrays `pred_a` and `pred_b`, each with shape `100x1x180x320` (The evaluation script will also accept predictions in the shape of `100x180x320`, if you decide to squeeze the channel dimension).\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Any result that does not meet the specified size will be considered invalid, resulting in an assessment score of zero.**\n",
    "  \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Relative Error} = \\frac{|y_i - \\hat{y}_i|}{|y_i|}\n",
